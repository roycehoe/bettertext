A live chat application built with mongodb, Express js, and socket.io.

# Backend
 - Implement socket.io on backend with socket.io client API
 - Implement REST API with Express router
 - Implement database with MongoClient to store message history for all chats

# Frontend
 - Implement socket.io on frontend with socket.io server API
 - Implement Axios client to make API calls to application backend
 - Use Vue.js to build chat application components
 - Utilize Vue Composition API to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic for chat history
 - Utilize Typescript to implement Typing and Interfaces
 - Implement responsive web design with Tailwind css and daisy.ui components

 # Deployment
 - Create Docker files for both backend and frontend
 - Implement docker-compose to create container networks
 - Implement a reverse proxy with Nginx to send requests to the respective containers, and to simplify deployment on a single server
 - Used DigitalOcean to deploy application on a virtual private server
 - Used Cloudflare to set up a DNS to redirect users from my application domain name to my virtual private server
